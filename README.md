# portquiz [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mkautzmann/portquiz.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mkautzmann/portquiz)

> A Node.JS CLI tool to check for open outbound TCP ports.


## Objective

This is a Node CLI tool based on [http://portquiz.net](http://portquiz.net) to test for open outbound ports in your computer.

This is particularly useful when you're trying to debug connection to other web
services or when you are trying to find a nice port to place some service you
are deploying.

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install -g portquiz`

This is a global and independent module so run it from your console and check
the results.

Install with cli command

```sh
$ npm install -g portquiz
$ portquiz --help
$ portquiz --version
```

If you're having permissions problems try using sudo for root privileges:

```sh
$ sudo npm install -g portquiz
$ portquiz --help
$ portquiz --version
```
